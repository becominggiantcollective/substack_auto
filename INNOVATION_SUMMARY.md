## üîß Technical Implementation

### New CLI Commands
```bash
python cli.py analytics    # View dashboard
python cli.py predict      # Predict performance
python cli.py trends       # Get trending topics
python cli.py abtest       # Manage A/B tests
python cli.py innovative   # Run features demo
```

### New Python APIs
```python
from main import ContentOrchestrator

orchestrator = ContentOrchestrator()
